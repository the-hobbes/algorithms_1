- An iterable is a class that has a method that returns an Iterator.
- An iterator is a class that has methods hasNext() and next()

This lets you do things like foreach statements. 
- java: 
    for (String s : stack)
      StdOut.prinln(s)
- python:
    for str in stack:
      print str

the client is always using hasNext() (in both the python an java versions here) in order to determine if there is another string in the stack in our example. 

Bag:
- when you need a datastructure to store objects, but order doesn't matter
- api looks like:
    bag()
    add(item)
    size()
    iterator() # iterator for all items in the bag.
